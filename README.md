K7NVH DC PDU
=======

The K7NVH DC PDU is a device designed to provide remote power control of DC devices in 
an affordable, low power, and flexible package. Each port is capable of handling 3+ 
amps, and can also measure the current flowing through each port.

Power can be supplied to the device via either USB or a standard barrel jack at 5V.

The device is available to the host system as a USB serial device, which when accessed 
accepts a number of basic ASCII commands which can be entered manually, or via a user 
created script to automate control actions.

This is the source code to be compiled by AVR-GCC for installation on the device itself.
The device should already have this installed, and is only needed if you want to make 
modifications.
